# Multivariate Statistical Analysis of Liver Disease Determinants

A comprehensive data science project applying advanced multivariate statistical techniques to analyze and interpret determinants of liver disease.

---

## 📊 Techniques Used

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**  
  Reduced dimensionality and identified key features influencing liver disease.
- **Factor Analysis:**  
  Explored underlying latent variables affecting the dataset.
- **Discriminant Analysis:**  
  Classified and differentiated between healthy and diseased cases.
- **Canonical Analysis:**  
  Investigated relationships between sets of variables for deeper insights.
